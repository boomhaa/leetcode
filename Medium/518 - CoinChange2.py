# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
# Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
# The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin]

        return dp[-1]
